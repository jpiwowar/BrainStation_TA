# What's this?
Assets for a 30-minute "watch me code stuff" demo to showcase basic Python 
scripting outside of Jupyter notebooks. Also introducing Data Science students
to some resources that may be of use during capstone development.
# Contents
* _DemoNotes.ipynb_  
Jupyter notebook with setup notes, code snippets, and clever(?) commentary for
use during the demo. No way am I going to give a 30-minute code talk w/o notes.
* _jpdemo_env.txt_  
Anaconda virtual environment file for the demo. Way easier than providing 
install instructions.
* _README.md_  
This file
* _sou.py_  
Intended final version of the script from the demo.  Even if we didn't quite 
get that far by the end.
