# What's this?
Assets for 30-minute "Tool tips" sessions for an introductory Data Science 
course.  Thus far, we've had one session on MySQL Workbench, and another on
Jupyter notebooks
# Contents
* _Getting to know Jupyter Notebooks.ipynb_  
Notebook to drive demonstration of basic navigation, code vs. markdown,
cell manipulation, and some features of Jupyter Lab
* _mysqlWorkbench/*.sql_  
Simple SQL snippets used during demo of mysql Workbench functionality.
Probably won't make much sense without context, but I might use them again. :)
* _README.md_
